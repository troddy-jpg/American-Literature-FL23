We will study the numerous aesthetic movements that informed literature in this period, such as the Puritan plain style, American Romanticism, and literary realism. We will also learn about the various literary genres and forms that became popular amid these aesthetic movements, among them the sermon, the autobiography, the essay, and the novel. The class will also cover such influential movements as transcendentalism, sentimentalism, and naturalism.
