*We acknowledge this place known as San Antonio as the traditional homeland of many Native American peoples who were called Coahuiltecan by the Spanish. 200 tribes/bands/clans were documented in historical records and include the Payaya, Auteca Paguame, Jarame, Pompopa, and Borrado, as well as other aboriginal peoples such as the Esto’k Gna who continue to carry their traditional lifeways.* 
# **Course Description** 
This course examines some of the major concerns and interests of American literature from the colonial era through the nineteenth century. We will study the numerous aesthetic movements that informed literature in this period, such as the Puritan plain style, American Romanticism, and literary realism. We will also learn about the various literary genres and forms that became popular amid these aesthetic movements, among them the sermon, the autobiography, the essay, and the novel. The class will also cover such influential movements as transcendentalism, sentimentalism, and naturalism. 
# **Course Requirements** 
Students are required to do all assigned readings and come to class prepared. This class includes several long works, so take advantage of light weeks by reading ahead. Course requirements include regular reading quizzes, two essays, a midterm, and a final exam.
